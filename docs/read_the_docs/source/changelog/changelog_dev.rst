        **Date**: 2024-06-21

        Title:
        Reduce garage protrusion slightly for 0-499 Geometry Floor Area

        Description:
        For the "0-499" Geometry Floor Area option, change the garage protrusion from 0.75 to 0.72.
        This avoids the "Garage is as wide as the single-family detached unit." error.
        Also add a new ResStockArguments test that creates geometry envelope for the 10K national project sample datapoints.

        Adding options and option arguments to Read the Docs

        Description:
        Adding to the read the docs documentation by articulating the options in project national and the arguments specified. One can now look at the descriptions of the arguments and documentation linked to OS-HPXML and see what arguments are currently being used in the baseline stock.
        The updates combines two files automatically: "options_lookup.tsv" and the "project_national/resuources/options_saturations.csv".

        Title:
        Split out Other and TV plug loads

        Description:
        Split out TV plug loads (calculated using an equation based on ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301) from other plug loads (calculated using updated regression equations based on RECS2020).
        For TV, we are now using OS-HPXML defaults (i.e., TV = 413.0 + 69.0 * NumberofBedrooms based on ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301-2019, where NumberofBedrooms is adjusted based on NumberofResidents).
        Create a new sources/recs/recs2020/plug_loads/mel_ann.py script.

        Description:
        Introduce a new optional `buildstock_csv_path` argument that supports parallel resstock runs using `run_analysis.rb`.
        I know this is an odd workflow, but I'd like to call resstock in parallel, to run multiple models (baseline only) built each with a precomputed buildstock.csv.

        Update threshold for weekday occupancy

        Description:
        RECS tsv_maker previously assumed that if people are home even for 1 day during the week, they are home every day of the week.
        This resulted in people being less away (and hence fewer day time setbacks). This PR updates the threshold for weekday occupancy to be 3 days.
        This makes the weekday occupancy more in line with RECS.
